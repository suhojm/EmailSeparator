## Introduction

This tool reads the emails from default gmail inbox. Then it categorizes and splits those emails into separate folders related to given keywords or sentiment.

 * This uses IBM Bluemix Natural Language Understanding api. Therefore, you need to get the api key by signing up the bluemix then put it into the config.cfg
 * Change and finish config.cfg first in order to run the tool. 
 * Compile and run the tool on terminal using EmailSeparaterMain class.


## Completeness

Only implementing basic functionality is done so far.
